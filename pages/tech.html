          Technology is my profession. This is where my logical left brain meets
          my creative right brain. A never ending cycle of learning and creating
          lies in technology and design. I hope you enjoy my projects and
          professional experiences.

        <h3>Capture Artist</h3>
        <h3>Dark Burn Creative, Los Angeles, CA, December 2017 - June 2019</h3>
        <p>
          Dark Burn is responsible for creating cinematically pleasing trailers
          for today's biggest games like Star Wars Battlefront II, Apex Legends,
          and BattleField. Essentially the job of a capture artist is the
          equivilant of being an actor on a film set. I was directed by our
          capture leader and was required to perform actions in order to get
          shots of new features or characters.

        <h3>Lead Designer, Software Engineer</h3>
        <h3>
          Senior Capstone: RentRocket, Bloomington, IN, August 2017 - May 2018
        </h3>
        <p>
          My Senior project! For my capstone project my group and I decided to
          take a client and help them create an application. We created the
          RentRocket app. The app allows users to post information about
          potential rentable housing. What makes the app different from sites
          like zillow and rentapad, is that our app also lets users view the
          average utility price for housing as well.

        </h3>
        <p>
          My first internship! Semcon is a government contractor group primarily
          working with the Federal Aviation Agency or FAA. During my experience
          I had the opportunity to travel all over the country and meet with
          different tech specialist within the FAA. I gained tremendous insight
          into the company and how it runs as a whole.
